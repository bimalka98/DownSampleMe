## About The Project

This repository includes all the project files related to the development of a `Custom processor in Verilog HDL` for image downsampling. The project was done by a team of 4 undergraduates at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. It was done as a pratial fulfillment of the requirements of UOM's EN3030 Circuits and Systems Design module.

The primary objective of this project was to design a Microprocessor and a CPU (Central Processing Unit) which can downsample the given `256x256` greyscale 8-bit image and generate correct results. The coding was done using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL).   `Xilinx Vivado` was used as an analysis and synthesis tool for the design of the processor and for the simulation of Verilog HDL designs.
